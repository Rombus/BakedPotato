 - Intial creation of "generator.php" with the following features:
	* Looks for any text file in the ./input folder (matches any .txt)
	* Runs text though Markdown
	* Generates a file in the ./ouput folder with the same name as the text file with the markdown (XHTML) output
	* Will do this for any number of .txt files in the ./input folder

 Notes and consideration points:
 * I need to consider what style of HTML i shoot for, HTML 5? XHTML 1.0? 1.1? I think XHTML 1.0 might be
   best, but i need to find out for sure. I'm pretty sure that markdown produces XHTML 1.0 strict, but i need to be sure.
